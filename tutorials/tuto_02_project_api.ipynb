    "This interface provides a few commands to control the EV3:\n",
    "* `move_forward(distance)` and `move_backward(distance)`:\n",
    "the `distance` argument has to be a `float` (in centimeters).\n",
    "* `steer_in_place(angle)`:\n",
    "the `angle` argument has to be a `float` (in degree).\n",

    "* The `distance` and `angle` arguments you will provide cannot be guaranteed!\n",
    "They are only approximations of the resulting movement.\n",
    "The actual movement highly depends on many physical parameters such as friction, sliding and instantaneous power.\n",
    "Hence, you should monitor the *true* position of the EV3 using the webcam.\n",
    "* The API is designed to work with the right motor connected to EV3 port A and the left motor connected to EV3 port D."
